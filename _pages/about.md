I am Crebonite *(Creh-bo-nite)*. Malaysian, hetero and go by he/him pronouns. I'm a geography student. I was born in 22 May 2008. I use a lot of mobile phone for daily lives, such as studying, hanging out, playing games, etc. 

I was a soundman on my school *(2023-2024)*, and then disbanded on 2025 for me to focus on SPM (*Sijil Matapelajaran Malaysia*), or Malaysian Subject Certificate (*MSC*) by a teacher who runs a soundman group, called **QMC**, which stands for **Quarter-master Ceremony.**

Life progress
======
I currently thinking about my future jobs. Could I be a Paleontologist, Soundman *(could be on JPN, or Jabatan Penerangan Negara (National Information Department)* or even a Train driver of **JKNS** (*Jabatan Keretapi Negeri Sabah*)/**KTM** (*Keretapi Tanah Melayu*).
